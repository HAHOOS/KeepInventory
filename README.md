# Keep Inventory
A BONELAB Mod that lets you keep items when switching between levels. This is my first ever code mod so please expect bugs, if a bug occurs, I recommend [creating an issue](https://github.com/HAHOOS/KeepInventory/issues).

This mod is inspired by [Inventory Persistence](https://thunderstore.io/c/bonelab/p/SilverWare/InventoryPersistence/) which in my case did not work for me and I've decided to remake it myself.
