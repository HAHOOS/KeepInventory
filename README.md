A BONELAB Code Mod that allows you to save your inventory for future use. It features:
- A save system that allows you to create, modify and delete saves in BoneMenu and files without needing to restart
- **Fusion Support**, including sharing saves with other players
- Blacklisting levels from loading/saving inventory
- And much more!

If you find any bugs within the mod, make sure to report the issue by DMing me (@hahoos on Discord) or creating an [issue](https://github.com/HAHOOS/KeepInventory/issues) on Github!
