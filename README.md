## What is this?

A BONELAB code mod that lets you keep your inventory when switching between levels that do not save your inventory or when rejoining the game. It features:
- **Full [Fusion](https://thunderstore.io/c/bonelab/p/Lakatrazz/Fusion/) Support, including sharing saves with others!**
- Multiple save slots
- Saving data about **guns** and loading them!
- Customizability, such as disabling inventory loading on level load, or saving/loading ammo
- And much more!

**WARNING!**
This mod might remove campaign data regarding the inventory while playing through campaign levels. You can change this behaviour at any time by going to the BoneMenu > HAHOOS > KeepInventory > Other and disabling `Remove Initial Inventory From Save`.

If you find any bugs, I recommend creating an [issue](https://github.com/HAHOOS/KeepInventory/issues). This will really help the development of the mod

## Possible bugs

- Saved gun with the slide locked might not load with it locked
- Guns not being put in inventory slots for new players in Fusion (I have asked Lakatrazz and he said it's a problem with Fusion)
